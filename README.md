## BYTESCRIPT

the imlamton for a basic language called bytescript 
bytescript can be: ran via intrupters
or:
complied to bytecode 
the bytecode version does not support PRINT ,  reason:

PRINT would reqiure complex methods to store the string as NOP's or whatever and address matching, etc.
How Varibles are handled in bytecode: varibles aer assigned a addres of a single byte , taht address refers to the name (diffrent form PRINT , sinc we dont need to know what hte orignal var name was.)
